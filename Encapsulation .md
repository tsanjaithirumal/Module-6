# 🐍 Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## 🎯 AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

---

## 💻 Program
```
class Rectangle:
length = 0
breadth = 0 def
init (self):
self___ length = 5
self___ breadth = 3
print(self. length)
print(self. breadth)
rect = Rectangle()
```
## Output
<img width="266" height="129" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/817e147d-a198-4e70-ad28-4b7eb359f810" />

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
